## spring 어노테이션의 이름을 설정해주는 이유
- It is mainly meant for solving ambiguity when performing an auto-scan and using @Autowired.
 
I gave a thorough answer explaining about @Autowired in this answer which also explains about the need to name the beans. 

Let's assume we have 2 classes that implement CustomerRepository:

~~~java
@Repository
public class MyCustomerRepositoryImpl implements CustomerRepository {
}

@Repository
public class OtherCustomerRepositoryImpl implements CustomerRepository {
}
~~~ 

Let's now assume we have a class that uses @Autowired to inject a CustomerRepository:
~~~java
public class SomeClass {
  @Autowired
  private CustomerRepository customerRepository;
}
~~~
When performing an auto-scan, you need to have a way to differentiate between them. 

Otherwise Spring would throw an exception saying that it can't tell which of the beans should be injected.

So we can now add a logical name to each implementation:
~~~java
@Repository("myRepository")
public class MyCustomerRepositoryImpl implements CustomerRepository {
}

@Repository("otherRepository")
public class OtherCustomerRepositoryImpl implements CustomerRepository {
}
~~~
And now you can help Spring solve the ambiguity as follows:
~~~java
public class SomeClass {
  @Autowired
  @Qualifier("myRepository")
  private CustomerRepository customerRepository;
}
~~~
